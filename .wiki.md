# Project Summary
The project is a web application that monitors and analyzes extractive activities in the Puglia region of Italy. It provides dynamic visualizations, statistics, and insights into authorized caves, enabling users to input data manually or upload Excel files for automated processing. The application enhances transparency and supports data-driven decision-making in the extractive sector.

# Project Module Description
The project consists of the following functional modules:
- **Authentication**: Secure login for administrative access.
- **Data Input**: Manual entry forms for cave data and Excel file uploads.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and dashboards displaying statistics on authorized caves by year, province, and material.
- **AI Commentary**: Automated analysis and commentary generation based on cave data.
