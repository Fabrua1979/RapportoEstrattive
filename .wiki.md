The project consists of the following functional modules:
- **Authentication**: Secure login for administrative access.
- **Data Input**: Manual entry forms for cave data and simplified Excel file uploads, covering all 10 chapters.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and dashboards displaying statistics on authorized caves by year, province, and material.
- **AI Commentary**: Automated analysis and commentary generation based on cave data, utilizing DeepSeek v3.2.
- **Data Export**: Functionality to export charts and tables in Excel format, including a button for downloading municipal data.
- **Data Reset**: Ability to reset data for specific years and sections.

- **Excel Parsing**: xlsx library for handling Excel files

# Usage
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies using the appropriate package manager.
   - Navigate to the frontend directory and run `pnpm install` to install frontend dependencies.

2. **Build and Run**:
   - Build the frontend application with `pnpm run build`.
   - Start the backend server and ensure it is running.

3. **Access the Application**:
   - Open the application in a web browser. Use the provided login page to access the administrative features.

4. **Using the Excel Upload**:
   - Prepare the Excel file with only authorized caves and 5 essential columns: Numero Fascicolo, Comune, Provincia, Stato Cava, Materiale.
