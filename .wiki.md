# Project Summary
The project is a comprehensive web application designed to monitor and analyze extractive activities in the Puglia region of Italy. It enhances transparency and supports data-driven decision-making in the extractive sector by providing dynamic visualizations and insights into authorized caves. Users can input data manually or upload simplified Excel files, making it a valuable tool for stakeholders such as government agencies, environmental organizations, and industry professionals.

# Project Module Description
The project consists of the following functional modules:
- **Authentication**: Secure login for administrative access.
- **Data Input**: Manual entry forms for cave data and simplified Excel file uploads, now expanded to cover all 9 chapters.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and dashboards displaying statistics on authorized caves by year, province, and material.
- **AI Commentary**: Automated analysis and commentary generation based on cave data.
- **Data Export**: Functionality to export charts and tables in Excel format.
- **Data Reset**: Ability to reset data for specific years and sections.
- **Dynamic Management**: Configurable management of provinces, materials, price materials, and foreign destinations.

# File Description Inventory
- **backend/**: Contains the server-side code, including API routes, database interactions, and business logic.
- **frontend/**: Contains the client-side code, including components, pages, and assets for the web application.

# Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Shadcn-UI, Recharts
- **Backend**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Atoms Backend (for database and authentication)
- **AI**: DeepSeek v3.2 for automatic commentary generation
- **Excel Parsing**: xlsx library for handling Excel files

# Usage
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies using the appropriate package manager.
   - Navigate to the frontend directory and run `pnpm install` to install frontend dependencies.

2. **Build and Run**:
   - Build the frontend application with `pnpm run build`.
   - Start the backend server and ensure it is running.

3. **Access the Application**:
   - Open the application in a web browser. Use the provided login page to access the administrative features.

4. **Using the Excel Upload**:
   - Prepare the Excel file with only authorized caves and 5 essential columns: Numero Fascicolo, Comune, Provincia, Stato Cava, Materiale.
   - Access the admin area after logging in.
   - Upload the prepared Excel file. The system will read all rows, delete old data for that year, and insert new records.
